# Book_Management_System
 Book Management System is a web application that allows users to manage books in a database. This application is built using JavaServer Pages (JSP) and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The system includes full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, and uses MySQL as the database management system.  The MVC architecture separates the application into three main components: the Model, which handles data and business logic, the View, which handles presentation and user interface, and the Controller, which handles user input and directs the flow of data between the Model and the View.  The Book Management System has been implemented with the following features:  A user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting books in the database. A search function to find specific books based on author, title, or ISBN. A pagination feature to display books in multiple pages. A login and registration system to restrict access to certain pages and features. The system is built using JSP and includes multiple pages for each component of the MVC architecture. The database is managed using MySQL, and the database connection is established through a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver. The CRUD operations are implemented using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.  This project was developed in Eclipse, a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Java programming. The code is well-structured and commented for easy understanding and future maintenance. Overall, the Book Management System is a fully functional application that demonstrates the power and flexibility of JSP and the MVC architecture.
